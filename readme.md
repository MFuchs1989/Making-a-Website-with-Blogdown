## Introduction

I am passionate about blogging, but wanted to avoid public sites like [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/de/) or [Medium](https://medium.com/).  
So I thought of another way and found out that you can create your own homepages with the help of [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

I really recommend watching the following YouTube video by [John Muschelli](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWI1xyk6Jb4t2OOyP2LS4DQ), where he demonstrates the same procedure live.

## Motivation: 

I've been blogging since 2018 on my homepages about all sorts of topics related to Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Data Science and much more.
To enable others to blog on their own homepage I wrote this tutorial.
